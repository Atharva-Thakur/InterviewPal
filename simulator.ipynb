       "'Question: How does BatchNormalization differ in training and inferencing\\nCorrect Answer: During training, Batch Normalization normalizes activations per batch. During inference, a running mean and variance are used based on the statistics accumulated during training.\\nCandidate Answer: idk\\nEvaluation: The candidate has performed poorly. The correct answer to the question is During training, Batch Normalization normalizes activations per batch. During inference, a running mean and variance are used based on the statistics accumulated during training.. The candidate\\'s answer of \"idk\" does not provide any useful information and shows that they do not understand the concept of BatchNormalization. I would rate the candidate\\'s answer a 1 out of 10.\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why dropout in a neural network acts as a regularizer.\\nCorrect Answer: Dropout acts as a regularizer by preventing neurons from relying too much on specific features, encouraging the network to learn more robust and generalizable representations.\\nCandidate Answer: idk\\nEvaluation: The candidate\\'s answer is not satisfactory. The correct answer is that dropout acts as a regularizer by preventing neurons from relying too much on specific features, encouraging the network to learn more robust and generalizable representations. The candidate\\'s answer of \"idk\" does not provide any information about why dropout acts as a regularizer. I would rate the candidate\\'s answer a 1 out of 10.\\n\\nQuestion: What is Bayesian inference\\nCorrect Answer: Bayesian inference is a statistical method for updating probabilities based on new evidence. It uses Bayes\\' theorem to estimate the probability of a hypothesis given observed data. It involves combining prior beliefs with likelihood to obtain a posterior probability.\\nCandidate Answer: idk\\nEvaluation: The candidate\\'s answer to the question \"What is Bayesian inference?\" is \"idk\". This is not a good answer, as it does not provide any information about what Bayesian inference is. I would rate the answer 0 out of 10.\\n\\nQuestion: How does Batch Normalization differ in training and inferencing\\nCorrect Answer: During training, Batch Normalization normalizes activations per batch. During inference, a running mean and variance are used based on the statistics accumulated during training.\\nCandidate Answer: idk\\nEvaluation: The candidate\\'s answer to the question \"How does Batch Normalization differ in training and inferencing\" is \"idk\". This is not a good answer, as it does not provide any information about the difference between Batch Normalization in training and inference. I would rate the answer a 1 out of 10.\\n\\nQuestion: Why large filter sizes in early layers can be a bad choice How to choose filter size\\nCorrect Answer: Large filter sizes in early layers may capture overly broad features, losing fine-grained details. Choosing filter size depends on the task and expected feature sizes. Smaller filters are often preferred for detailed pattern recognition.\\nCandidate Answer: idk\\nEvaluation: The candidate\\'s answer is not satisfactory. The correct answer to the question is \"Large filter sizes in early layers may capture overly broad features, losing fine-grained details. Choosing filter size depends on the task and expected feature sizes. Smaller filters are often preferred for detailed pattern recognition.\". The candidate\\'s answer \"idk\" does not provide any information and is not helpful. I would rate the candidate\\'s answer 1 out of 10.\\n\\n'"
